            Description and Concept:
        </h1>
        <p>
            This project is to create an imaginary creature using the p5 editor. I created some cute dragons, which
            contain
            transformation functions and push () & pop () in order to make the rotation of their teeth and tails. Also,
            it
            contains an array to change the size of the dragons. Different functions are also included to create
            different
            parts of the dragon.

        <p>
            For my project, the most important part is the function drawCreature (). Since it contains all the main
            parts of
            a dragon and calls all the functions of different body parts of a dragon. In this function, I created three
            crazy dragons with different positions, sizes, and rotating speeds of their tails. At first, I tried to make
            all
            three of them have color-changing teeth, however, I found out that the positions of the teeth are uncertain,
            I
            bet it’s the rotation part that went wrong, and I failed to correct them. Therefore, I deleted their teeth.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second most important part of this project is the function drawHorn (). At first, I intended to make
            random
            colors of their teeth and horns each time the code runs. However, if I want their tails to move, I can’t
            noLoop
            () the drawHorn function. Maybe I just don’t know how to control different functions separately. However, I
            found the color changes craze, which is actually pretty cool. Therefore I decided to make them just like
            that,
            and call them crazy dragons. I really like this surprising outcome! I also struggled with rotating a line of
            triangles, because I was not sure about the angles and the positions of different lines of triangles. I used
            the
            experimental method to test it out.

        <p>
            Meanwhile, it took me a really long time to create their feet, which contain in function drawFeet (). I
            created
            six different triangles and rotate them separately, which is really time-consuming and I had tried thousands
            of
            times to put them in the appropriate positions. After finishing this part, I rethink about it, I guess a
            better
            method should be using a for loop () to create a certain number of triangles and then rotate them together.
            But
            I’m not so sure how to just rotate them to form a half-circle.

            -I used numbers stored in the array, in order to change the size of the dragons. I wanted to create random
            size dragons, however, their size will change all the time if I code random(). I may need further
            exploration of array ().

        <p2>
            -We need to use translate () when moving the center position, in order to simplify the process of rotating
            a
            shape around its center point. Push () and pop () are used to make the codes between them independent from
            the codes outside. Therefore, we can change a special part of our code while not affecting other parts.
        </p2>

        <h1></h1>

        <p3>
            -In this case, we can only create one function and call it several times to create a number of shapes with
            different measures.
        </p3>

        <p4>
            -Position, rotation, and size. I can create dragons at different positions, rotate their tails at different
            rates, and also create dragons with different sizes.
        </p4>

        <h1></h1>

        <p5>
            -I can no longer write so many codes to create a similar pattern, but just write a function and call it
            several times. I think it’s convenient and practical.
